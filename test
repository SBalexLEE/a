One property that we see all the time in social graphs (and many other graphs) is the emergence of a "giant" connected component. The Erdös-Rényi also develops a giant component for certain parameter spaces. In fact, when the average degree is more than 1 we see a giant component emerging, and when it is more that 3 that giant component is all or almost all of the graph. That means that for a random graph with $p > \frac{1}{n-1}$ we will always start to see a giant component.

To demonstrate why this is true, consider $u$ to be the fraction of vertices not in the giant component. Then where $u$ is also the probability that a randomly chosen vertex $i$ does not belong to the giant component of the graph. For $i$ to not be a part of the giant component, for every other vertex $j$ ($n-1$ vertices), $i$ is either not connected to $j$ (with probability $1-p$), or $j$ is not connected to the giant component (with probability $pu$). Then: $$ u = ((1-p) + (pu))^{n-1} $$ We can use $ p = \frac{\bar k}{n-1} $ to rewrite the expression as: $$ u = (1 - \frac{\bar k(1-u)}{n-1})^{n-1} $$ And then taking the limit for large $n$ and using the fact that $\lim_{x\rightarrow\infty}(1-\frac{x}{n})^n = e^{-x}$: $$ u = e^{-k(1-u)} $$ Now if $u$ is the fraction of vertices not in the giant component, call $S = 1-u$ the fraction of vertices in the giant component. Then: $$ S = e^{-\bar kS} $$

There is no closed-form solution to this equation, but below we can show a simulation of random graphs and the size of the largest connected component in each one.
